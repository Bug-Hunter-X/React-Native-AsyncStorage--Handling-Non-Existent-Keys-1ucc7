This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in React Native and trying to access a value that doesn't exist.  It typically manifests as a TypeError or a similar error indicating that you're trying to perform an operation on a null or undefined value.  The problem is that `AsyncStorage.getItem` returns a Promise, and you might be trying to access the value synchronously before the Promise resolves.  Another common cause is incorrect error handling when dealing with `AsyncStorage.getItem`'s rejection.
